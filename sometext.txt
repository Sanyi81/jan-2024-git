Beavis and Butt-Head is an American adult animated black comedy series created by Mike Judge
 for MTV (seasons 1–8) and later Paramount+ (season 9–present, as Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-Head).
 [2] The series follows Beavis and Butt-Head, both voiced by Judge, a pair of teenage slackers characterized
  by their apathy, lack of intelligence, lowbrow humor, and love for hard rock and heavy metal.

Beavis and Butt-Head was created by the American animator Mike Judge for his short film Frog Baseball,
 which was played on MTV's animation showcase Liquid Television. MTV ordered a full series, which ran
  for seven seasons from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997.[12][13][8] Judge is critical of the animation
  in earlier episodes, in particular the first two—"Give Blood/Blood Drive" and "Door to Door"—which he
   described as "Horrible. Those first two episodes were awful, I don't know why anybody liked it ... I
   was burying my head in the sand."[14] In addition, the studio which worked on the first season was
   supposed to have 22 episodes done by March 8, 1993, and only had two finished ("Give Blood/Blood Drive"
    and "Door to Door").
