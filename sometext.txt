Beavis and Butt-Head are unintelligent teenage boys who live in the town of Highland, Texas.
[8] Rolling Stone described them as "thunderously stupid and excruciatingly ugly".[9] They spend
 time watching television, drinking unhealthy beverages, eating,[10] and embarking on "mundane,
  sordid" adventures, which often involve vandalism, abuse, violence, or animal cruelty.
  [9] According to The Baltimore Sun, Beavis and Butt-Head are "at their most incorrect when it
   comes to sexuality and matters of gender. The nicest thing you can say about them in this regard
    is that they are budding misogynists."[10] When Beavis consumes too much caffeine or sugar, he becomes
     Cornholio, a hyperactive alter ego.[11] Over the course of the series, Beavis and Butt-Head
      developed more distinct personalities; Butt-Head is the leader and "devious visionary", while
       Beavis, the sidekick, is the "loose cannon".[11]
Beavis and Butt-Head is an American adult animated black comedy series created by Mike Judge
 for MTV (seasons 1–8) and later Paramount+ (season 9–present, as Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-Head).
 [2] The series follows Beavis and Butt-Head, both voiced by Judge, a pair of teenage slackers characterized
  by their apathy, lack of intelligence, lowbrow humor, and love for hard rock and heavy metal.

Beavis and Butt-Head was created by the American animator Mike Judge for his short film Frog Baseball,
 which was played on MTV's animation showcase Liquid Television. MTV ordered a full series, which ran
  for seven seasons from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997.[12][13][8] Judge is critical of the animation
  in earlier episodes, in particular the first two—"Give Blood/Blood Drive" and "Door to Door"—which he
   described as "Horrible. Those first two episodes were awful, I don't know why anybody liked it ... I
   was burying my head in the sand."[14] In addition, the studio which worked on the first season was
   supposed to have 22 episodes done by March 8, 1993, and only had two finished ("Give Blood/Blood Drive"
    and "Door to Door").
