Beavis and Butt-Head are unintelligent teenage boys who live in the town of Highland, Texas.
[8] Rolling Stone described them as "thunderously stupid and excruciatingly ugly".[9] They spend
 time watching television, drinking unhealthy beverages, eating,[10] and embarking on "mundane,
  sordid" adventures, which often involve vandalism, abuse, violence, or animal cruelty.
  [9] According to The Baltimore Sun, Beavis and Butt-Head are "at their most incorrect when it
   comes to sexuality and matters of gender. The nicest thing you can say about them in this regard
    is that they are budding misogynists."[10] When Beavis consumes too much caffeine or sugar, he becomes
     Cornholio, a hyperactive alter ego.[11] Over the course of the series, Beavis and Butt-Head
      developed more distinct personalities; Butt-Head is the leader and "devious visionary", while
       Beavis, the sidekick, is the "loose cannon".[11]
