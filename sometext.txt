Beavis and Butt-Head is an American adult animated black comedy series created by Mike Judge
 for MTV (seasons 1–8) and later Paramount+ (season 9–present, as Mike Judge's Beavis and Butt-Head).
 [2] The series follows Beavis and Butt-Head, both voiced by Judge, a pair of teenage slackers characterized
  by their apathy, lack of intelligence, lowbrow humor, and love for hard rock and heavy metal.

The characters originated in Judge's 1992 short film Frog Baseball with the second film being called
 Peace, Love and Understanding, which was broadcast by MTV's animation showcase Liquid Television.
  After MTV commissioned a full series, Beavis and Butt-Head ran for seven seasons from 1993 to 1997.
  [3][4] It was revived with an eighth season aired on MTV in 2011. A second revival, consisting of an
   initial two-season order, premiered on Paramount+ in 2022.
